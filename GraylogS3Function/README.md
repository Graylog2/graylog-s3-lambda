# Graylog S3 Lambda
An AWS Lambda function payload that reads log files S3 and publishes sends them to Graylog.

This repository will be used for the S3 -> Graylog proof of concept and eventually the final function that we plan to publish. 

This repository is private for now. Please add approprate licensing before making public.
